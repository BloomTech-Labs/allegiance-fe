## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React

ðŸš« Why did you choose this framework?

- React's virtual DOM in ReactJS makes for faster development and better user experience
- Designed for an app like ours featuring various configs of reusable user-specific components

#### Front end deployed to `Netlify`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/labs15-allegiance/backend/) built using:

#### ðŸš« Node/Express

- Allows for quick building of scalable network applications
- REST APP is predictable, and doesn't expose database architecture to FE
- Very clean, DRY code using packages/middleware for validation, error handling, etc.
